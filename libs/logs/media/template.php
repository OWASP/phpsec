/**
 *					******************NOTE******************
 * 
 * Template file.
 * -------------------
 * 
 * This is a user customizable file. This file lists the filds that the user wants in their logs. E.g they may want Log Messages, Date, FileLocation etc.
 * For each of the field they require, those fields must be listed here.
 * 
 * Note: Please note that the fields are listed here in the order of their priority. i.e. list those fields first which are necessary and are must to be provided. Although, a user may not provide any value to the logs which is OK - defaults will be set.
 * 
 * The reason they need to be in order is because, while calling the log() function, the user must pass all the data as they are listed here.
 * 
 * e.g.: 
 *	 //Correct. Notice that we have provided values in order.
 *	 log($message, $type, $priority); 
 *	 log($message, $type);
 *	 log($message);
 * 
 *	 //Incorrect because values are not provided in order. This will cause values to be exchanged with each other.
 *	 log($message, $priority, $type);
 *	 log($message, $datetime);
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 					******************NOTE 2******************
 * 
 * How to Change this template.
 * ------------------------------------
 * 
 * Changing this template to your own needs is very easy. All you need to do is add/delete the data in the array according to priority. So lets say you want
 * to add data "CLASS" after "MESSAGE", then you will add the value "CLASS" after message and will provide the default value if needed. Later when you call the
 * log function, then you have to remember calling them using the correct order. i.e.
 * log($message, $class, $type, ... );
 * 
 * If you are just using files, then no more additional change needs to be done.
 * However, if you are using the DB, or maybe will use in future, you need to add this extra column "CLASS" in the DB inside your appropriate "tableName (default 'LOGS')".
